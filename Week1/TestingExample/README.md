# Testing Q# Code

This project teaches you to invoke and test Q# operations similar to the ones from the homework assignments. It shows the following parts of the testing process:
* allocating the qubits and preparing the input states;
* invoking your operations;
* inspecting the wave function of the quantum state;
* printing the values of classical variables;
* asserting that the quantum state matches the expected one.

You can find more elaborate testing harnesses in the [Quantum Katas project](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/).
